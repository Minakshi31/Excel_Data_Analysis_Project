# E-commerce sales analysis 

# •	AIM: 
This project analyzes an e-commerce sales dataset to provide key business insights, including top product categories, monthly sales trends, regional sales performance, and essential metrics like total sales, profit, and order volume. The dashboard enables data-driven decisions by highlighting customer demand trends, seasonal peaks, and best-selling subcategories.
# •	Process
1.	Data Collection & Cleaning: Gather and prepare sales data for analysis.
2.	Dashboard Design:
•	KPI Summary: Show total sales, profit, quantity, order count, and profit margin with YOY growth.
•	Sales & Profit Trends: Monthly analysis for seasonal insights.
•	Category and Region Analysis: Visualize category profits, sales share, state-wise performance, and top subcategories.
•	Filters: Allow filtering by year, segment, and region.
3.	Insights Extraction: Identify patterns and trends in the data to guide strategy.
4.	My favorite step is creating a dashboard full of useful insights. I arranged all of them and used story-telling to make the crucial insights speak clearly with the help of PivotCharts.
